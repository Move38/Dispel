# Dispel!
(formerly known as Blackout!)

Dispel! challenges you to turn off all faces of your puzzle by applying the correct combination of runes. Use your logic, deduction, and wits to dispel the hex!

## SETUP
With your tiles programmed, they will be sparkling colors. Click a tile to select it as your Hex tile. It will glow blue. All tiles touching your Hex tile automatically become Rune tiles and display randomly changing patterns.

`TIP: If you accidentally create more than one blue Hex tile, hold the button to reset it and start over.`

## DIFFICULTY
There are two methods to adjust puzzle difficulty: number of Rune tiles, and Rune pattern complexity.

### NUMBER OF RUNES
During setup, you may add or remove Rune tiles by attaching or detaching them from your Hex tile. You can have from one to six Rune tiles in play, though only having one or two runes will make the puzzle trivially easy. In general, the more Rune tiles in play, the more difficult the puzzle. Set aside any unused tiles.

### RUNE COMPLEXITY
You can also increase the pattern complexity on your Rune tiles. Click the Hex tile to cycle through all six difficulty levels. The number of pulsing yellow faces on the Hex tile indicates the current complexity level.

`TIP: First time player? Start with two or three Rune tiles at complexity level one. You’ll get the hang of it faster!`

## PLAY
Satisfied with the difficulty? Double click the Hex tile to begin. The Hex tile now contains your puzzle and the Rune tiles have revealed their patterns. The game is on!

### RUNE COLOR
Each rune starts white, which means it has no effect on the puzzle. Click a rune to cycle among red, green, and blue. Runes attached to the Hex tile will toggle the same color on the same faces of the puzzle. Meaning, if the puzzle face contains the color, it will turn off, otherwise it will turn on.

### RUNE ROTATION
Rotate your Rune tile by detaching, turning, and reattaching it to the Hex tile. This lets you control the faces of the hex that are affected by the rune.

`TIP: It doesn’t matter to which side of the Hex tile you attach the Rune tile.`

### COLOR COMBINATIONS
Don’t forget that base colors combine. For example, a magenta face is a combination of red and blue. You will need to toggle all lit colors, using a combination of runes, to completely turn off a face.

`TIP: Double click any Rune tile to disable it and turn it back to white. Double click the Hex tile to disable all connected Rune tiles and start the puzzle over.`

## RESET
At any time you may reset the tiles by holding down any button in the cluster.

## WIN CONDITION
You win once you fully dispel the hex! You will be treated with a magic rainbow burst. Click any tile to reset and start anew.
There is at least one guaranteed solution for every puzzle, but there may be more. There may even be a solution that does not use every rune!
