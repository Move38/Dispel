# Blackout!
### Summary
Blackout! is a single player puzzle game for 2-7 Blinks. Realistically, you'll want at least 4 Blinks to have a minimum of challenge.

The goal is to turn off all the colors on your Working Tile using the surrounding Tool Tiles.

### Setup
After programming your tiles, they will display a slowly spinning half-face on each tile.

#### Working Tile
Click one tile to choose it as your Working Tile. It will turn blue with a single yellow wedge. That yellow wedge indicates your selected puzzle difficulty.

Difficulty ranges from 1-6 and affects the patterns on the Tool Tiles you are given. Higher difficulties give more complicated Tool Tiles. Double click the Working Tile to cycle your difficulty level.

#### Tool Tiles
All tiles touching your Working Tile automatically become Tool Tiles and turn solid white. Add or remove Tool Tiles as you wish before starting the game. More Tool Tiles also increases difficulty. [**Hint: Start with two or three Tool Tiles on difficulty 1 to learn the basics**]

### Play
Once you have selected your difficulty level and number of Tool Tiles, click the Working Tile again to start the game. Your Working Tile will reveal the puzzle and your Tool Tiles will show their assigne patterns in white.

Your goal is to turn off all of the colors on your Working Tile.

#### Manipulating Tool Tiles
Clicking a Tool Tile will cycle its color to Red, then Green, then Blue, and back to White. When not white, the Tool Tile will influence your Working Tile by toggling that color on all of the corresponding faces.

For instance, if your Tool Tile is red and has its top face lit, then attaching it to your Working Tile will toggle the red color on *its* top face.

You can also detach and rotate tiles so that they influence the faces you want on the Working Tile.

### Winning

Can you deduce the correct combinations of colors and rotations for your Tool Tiles that will result in a Blackout on the Working Tile?

There is at least one guaranteed solution for every puzzle. Some may have more than one solution or even be solvable without using all of the Tool Tiles.

Once you win, click any tile to reset all tiles to their starting state. You can then select a new difficulty or number of Tool Tiles for your next puzzle.

Good luck!
